Introduction
The WidgetBasket class is designed to calculate the total cost of a basket of widgets based on the provided product prices, delivery charge rules, and special offers. It takes into account the quantity of items in the basket, applies any relevant discounts or offers, and calculates the delivery charges according to the specified rules.

Assumptions
Product Catalogue: The class assumes that the product catalogue is defined with accurate product codes and prices in the $productCatalogue array.

Delivery Charge Rules: The class assumes that the delivery charge rules are provided in the $deliveryRules array with the correct thresholds and charges for orders under certain amounts.

Special Offers: The class assumes that the special offers are defined in the $offers array. If there are no special offers, this array can be left empty.

How It Works
The WidgetBasket class has three main methods:

__construct($productCatalogue, $deliveryRules, $offers): Initializes the class instance with the product catalogue, delivery charge rules, and special offers.

add($productCode): Adds a product to the basket by its product code. If the product code exists in the product catalogue, it's added to the basket for further calculation.

total(): Calculates the total cost of the basket considering the added products, special offers, and delivery charge rules. The method returns the calculated total cost.

Usage
To use the WidgetBasket class:

Include the class definition from WidgetBasket.php in your PHP script.

Define the product catalogue, delivery charge rules, and special offers arrays.

Create an instance of the WidgetBasket class using the provided arrays.

Use the add() method to add product codes to the basket.

Call the total() method to calculate the total cost of the basket.

Example
php
Copy code
// Include the class definition
require_once 'WidgetBasket.php';

// Define product catalogue, delivery rules, and offers
$productCatalogue = [
    // ... Define product codes and prices
];

$deliveryRules = [
    // ... Define delivery charge rules
];

$offers = [
    // ... Define special offers
];

// Create a new WidgetBasket instance
$widgetBasket = new WidgetBasket($productCatalogue, $deliveryRules, $offers);

// Add product codes to the basket
$widgetBasket->add('R01');
$widgetBasket->add('G01');
// ... Add more products

// Calculate the total
$total = $widgetBasket->total();
